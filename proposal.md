# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Two Player MineSweeper

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A MineSweeper game that is two player with you vs a computer competing to find the most bombs.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software for each game will generate a game board full of squares. Each square will either have a bomb or a number corresponding to how many bombs border that square. For each game the board should be different and the bombs randomly dispersed. The game will be between you the player and a computer. When playing each turn will last 10 seconds or until the first click. However, if you find a bomb your score will increase, a flag will show where the bomb was, and two seconds will be added to your turn time allowing you to click again. The game goes until all bombs are found or the number of bombs left is less than the difference of score. The first feature will be to input your name, so the game can call you by what you want to be called. The second feature is that you can choose your team color from a small list of options, allowing you to differentiate your flag color from the computer's. The last feature will be before the game starts and will ask you whether nor not you have played MineSweeper before. If yes, the game will start telling you to collect the most flags to win, or if no it will explain how to play MineSweeper. It will be executed through a series of if statements, while loops, and for loops among others.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish the single player portion of the game no matter what. That is trying to find all the bombs as fast as possible.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish programming a basic computer opponent to play against by the project deadline.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I can accomplish creating the whole game of playing MineSweeper against a computer oppponent to collect the most flags. In this version possibly having different skill levels of the computer opponent that the player can choose through an input.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps begin with research. I will need to find out how to receive feedback/input from a user through clicking. MineSweeper revolves around clicking different squares you think may or may not be the bomb. Depending on what is clicked I will have to have seperate outcomes. I will also need to find out how to generate the board setup for each new game. Also, programming the computer to make logical choices will be difficult. Depending on the player's clicks, it will have to decide the best outcome for itself. Finding out how to program it to do this with a different board setup each time will be tricky. A new skill I will have to acquire it making my programs more interactive. For it to be a true game, it must interact with the user to create a fun and challenging output.
