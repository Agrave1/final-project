Year: Junior
PRoject Title: Two Player Minesweeper
Difficulties faced: Starting off on a large project felt like one step forward, two steps back. The most difficult aspect was programming the computer, as I overlooked many things when I first went through telling it what to do, as for a human it made sense to not do that specific thing. Obviously, a computer can only due what you tell, but that is easier said than done.
Thing I learned: The importance of the print statement. When I faced the problems as mentioned above, the print state,et allowed me to see what was happening behind the scenes, to go me a better look at what was going wrong. Sometimes the biggest problems are solved with the simplest functions.
What I enjoyed: The little victories. What I mean is these large projects and coding pieces are made up of many functions. When one worked and was able to be pieced together it was a little victory that gave me motivation to keep going.
